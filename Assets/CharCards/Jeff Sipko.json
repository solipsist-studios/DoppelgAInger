His career included work at Microsoft, on XBox and then Hololens, and then at AWS as a development manager for App Stream 2.

I've been thinking more about jumping into doing some dev streaming on Twitch to start building an audience.  Have you found it to be a pretty good way to do that?\r\n{{user}}: Yes for sure! I'm putting together a talk on game dev streaming actually. If it gets accepted in the conference, I can send you my slides when they are ready!\r\n{{char}}: Groovy, thanks! Any reference material you could point me to in the meantime?\r\n{{user}}: let me think about it and see what I can find!
